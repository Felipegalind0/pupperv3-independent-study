    Pupper Robot

In this course students will gain hands-on experience with animal-inspired robotics. For the first six weeks, students will complete a sequence of labs that start from simple motor control and culminate in building a full quadruped robot called Pupper (pictured above). Labs are preceeded by short lectures to prepare students, with topics including motor control, kinematics, inverse kinematics, dynamics, haptics, simulation, reinforcement learning and more.  In the last four weeks of the course, students will pursue an open-ended project using Pupper as a platform, such as teaching Pupper to walk using reinforcement learning, building a vision system to allow Pupper to fetch, or redesigning the hardware to make the robot more agile. 

Researchers from Google Brain will give a guest lecture during the quarter on their work teaching robots new skills using reinforcement learning. 

Expected time commitment: 6 - 8 hours per week.

Estimated class size: 8 - 12 students

Prerequisites: CS106B or similar coding experience strongly recommended. Coding for the robot will be done in Python and C++. No robotics experience necessary.

Grading: Pass/Fail for 2 or more units. Grading based on participation.

Faculty sponsor: Mac Schwager
